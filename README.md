## User Guide
- ADD AN ITEM: To add a new item to the list, you must:
1. Enter description of the item in the text field next to the "Item:" label
(must be between 1 and 256 characters). If it is not valid or a duplicate
item description, you will run into this message until it is valid: 
"One or more invalid entries, please try again."
2. Enter due date of the item in the text field next to the "Due Date:" label
(must be a valid due date in YYYY-MM-DD format). If it is not a valid date
in the Gregorian Calendar, you will run into this message until it is valid:
"One or more invalid entries, please try again."
3. Check the checkbox next to the label "Check If Complete" only if the item
is already completed. If it is not already complete, leave the box unchecked.

- MARK ITEM AS COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE: If you'd like to mark an item complete/incomplete

like to edit, swap it, and press the enter key. You must either type "true"
