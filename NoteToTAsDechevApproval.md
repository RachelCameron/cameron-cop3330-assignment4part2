Due to running into a multitude issues of issues while trying to copy my part 1 project over, I was given permission by Dr. Dechev to start an entirely new project for part 2. His only request was that I included a note (which is this) to the TAs letting them know of his approval so I can still get full points. Here is a screenshot link of the email where he says as much to further verify this: https://i.imgur.com/7O30kQD.png - Thank you so much! :)
